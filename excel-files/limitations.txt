limitations of using pandas in excel

• When writing DataFrames to files, you can’t include a title or a chart.

• There is no way to change the default format of the header and index in Excel.

• When reading files, pandas automatically transforms cells with errors like #REF!
or #NUM! into NaN , making it impossible to search for specific errors in your
spreadsheets.

• Working with big Excel files may require extra settings that are easier to control
by using the reader and writer packages directly, as we will see in the next
chapter.
